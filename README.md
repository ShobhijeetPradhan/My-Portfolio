About The Project
This project is more than just a portfolio; it's a complete single-page application (SPA) designed to showcase my skills in both web and game development sensibilities. From the fluid animations to the real-time backend, every component was crafted to create an engaging and professional user experience.

The core of the application is a smooth-scrolling interface that guides the user through different sections of my profile. The standout feature is a full-stack comment section, allowing visitors to leave public messages with profile pictures, all updated in real-time for every user.

âœ¨ Features
Animated Welcome Screen: A slick, animated entry point to the application.

Smooth Scrolling SPA: A seamless single-page experience with a navigation bar that tracks the user's position.

Real-Time Comment Section: Visitors can post comments with their name and an optional profile picture. Comments appear instantly for all users thanks to Supabase's real-time subscriptions.

Supabase Backend: Utilizes Supabase for:

PostgreSQL Database: Storing all comments.

Storage: Hosting user-uploaded profile pictures.

Realtime: Pushing live updates to all connected clients.

Dynamic Project & Certificate Showcase: All portfolio content is fetched dynamically from the Supabase database.

Fully Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach ensures the site looks and works perfectly on all devices, from phones to desktops.

Modern Animations: Subtle, performant animations powered by Framer Motion and AOS (Animate on Scroll) to enhance the user experience.
